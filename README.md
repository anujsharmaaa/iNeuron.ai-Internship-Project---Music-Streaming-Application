## Internship Project 


# iNeuron.ai Internship Project -  Music Streaming Application


# Project Details 


This project is part of the Full Stack Javascript Web Developer Bootcamp taught and curated by Hitesh Choudhary Sir and the wonderful team of iNeuron.
And Also Thnakyou iNeuron For Give Us Such Like Opportunity.


## Promblem Statement

Design a ‚ÄúMusic Streaming Application‚Äù where the users can listen to their favorite music
anytime, anywhere.


## What is a Music Streaming Application?

A Music Streaming Application is a site where users can search for any music of their choice,
or choose from the available music and stream the music online.
Now that you understand what a Music Streaming Application is, let‚Äôs discuss some of the
‚ÄúMusic Streaming Application‚Äù functionality you will design.
1. Design a homepage where users can see the top played/trending songs.
2. Create a player which can play the music and the user is able to see the details about the
song that is currently being played along with the remaining time and on-screen controls to
play/pause the music.



## Features

- Live previews
- Fullscreen mode
- Cross platform


## üõ† Skills
HTML, CSS, Java Script , ReactJS





# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
